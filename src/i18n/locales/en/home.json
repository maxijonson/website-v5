        "text": "I'm a software engineering student located in Montreal, Quebec. I have a great passion and experience for Web development, from Front-End to Back-End. My favorite programming language has always been JavaScript (more specifically, TypeScript) and I always get excited to try out new technologies to build something amazing! I love to learn new things and I'm always looking for ways to improve myself, such as self learning by trying them out, taking an online course or participating in a CTF.\n\nI am also a big Star Wars fan. Whenever a new series or season comes out, I'll be first to watch it! I love EDM music and my favorite artist is Illenium. I like putting some good jam on to fuel my coding fingers! I am also a huge dog lover and am the proud owner of an adorable Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier named \"Kingsley\"!"
